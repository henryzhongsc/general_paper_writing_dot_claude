Commit and push changes to both the `.claude` submodule and the parent project repo.

**Steps:**

1. Check for changes in `.claude` submodule. If changes exist:
   - Stage all changes
   - Commit with a concise message
   - Push to the submodule remote

2. Check for changes in the parent repo (including the updated submodule reference). If changes exist:
   - Stage all changes
   - Commit with a concise message
   - Push to the parent remote

**Output:** Report what was committed and pushed in each repo, or indicate if there were no changes.
